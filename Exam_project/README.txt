Data files:
    -   ml.csv the final csv for machine learning
    -   Final_cleaned.csv: the file with all variables, from straping boigsiden, splitting string data and with geocoding and distances.

The scraping is done with scraping.ipynb
Cleaning with Cleaned.ipynd
Data description with descriptive_analysis.ipynb
Machine learning with ml2.ipynb, and Machine_Learning.ipynb
An alternative Machinelearning pipeline to correct for convergence warining, that was too processor intensive in alt_ml.ipynb
    -    with polynomial order 1,2 and 3, gridsearch, and predictions, learning curves and validation curves, for Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet,
